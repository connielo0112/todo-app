## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or above)
- MongoDB Atlas account or local MongoDB installation
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-app.git
   cd todo-app
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies
   ```
   cd todo-frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root (for the backend) and one inside `todo-frontend/` (for the frontend)

   - One in the **project root** (for the backend):
   ```
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```
   
   - One inside the **frontend folder**:
   ```
   PORT=8000
   ```

5. Start the backend server
   ```
   cd ..
   node index.js
   ```

6. Start the frontend development server
   ```
   cd todo-frontend
   npm start
   ```

7. Open your browser and navigate to:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:8000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3000/tasks

## Testing API with Postman or curl

You can test backend endpoints directly:

Create a new task:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tasks -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Test task"}'
```


## Future Improvements
